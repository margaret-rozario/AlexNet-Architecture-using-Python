# AlexNet-Architecture-using-Python
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that gained significant attention and set the foundation for deep learning breakthroughs in computer vision tasks. 
Here's a short description of the AlexNet architecture using Python:

AlexNet consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The architecture incorporates key components such as convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dropout regularization.

In Python, you can implement the AlexNet architecture using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Here's a high-level overview of the architecture's layers and operations:

Input Layer: The first layer accepts the input image data, typically with dimensions of 224x224 pixels.

Convolutional Layers: The architecture begins with five convolutional layers, each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. These layers learn hierarchical features by applying convolution operations on the input image, extracting low-level and high-level features.

Max-Pooling Layers: After each convolutional layer, a max-pooling layer is applied to reduce spatial dimensions and provide translation invariance.

Dropout Regularization: Dropout layers are inserted after the last two convolutional layers and the first two fully connected layers. Dropout randomly deactivates a certain percentage of neurons during training, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.

Fully Connected Layers: The architecture concludes with three fully connected layers, which perform classification based on the learned features. Each fully connected layer is followed by a ReLU activation, except for the output layer.

Output Layer: The final fully connected layer, with a softmax activation function, produces the predicted probabilities for different classes.

By training AlexNet on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, the architecture demonstrated significant improvements in image classification accuracy and paved the way for subsequent advancements in deep learning and computer vision.

Implementing AlexNet in Python using deep learning frameworks allows you to leverage pre-trained models, fine-tune the architecture for specific tasks, or create new variations of the original architecture to suit your needs.
